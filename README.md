# Getting Started with CitrusUI

## Welcome to CitrusUI

CitrusUI is a modern React UI library builded on top of ShadcnUI designed to help you customize your project with ease.

Please have a look to ShadcnUI documentation to get more information about the library.

## Installation

To get started with CitrusUI, you just need to follow the steps from ShadcnUI documentation, nothing else is required.

## Basic Usage

The components in this library are the same of Shadcn with some little twerks that don't affect the usage.

To use it you can just import the new UI components from the library and use them as you would use the ShadcnUI components.

You DON'T need to apply any modification on your project, this new UI component works directly with the component made with ShadcnUI.
